Here is a list of some of my favorite apologetics blogs and other resources.  Many of these have been instrumental in my own journey into the world of Christian apologetics.

* [Stand To Reason](https://www.str.org/)
* [Cross Examined](https://crossexamined.org/)
* [Reasonable Faith](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/)
* [Cold Case Christianity](https://coldcasechristianity.com/)
