In 2014, I completed a Master of Arts in Theological Studies with Liberty University. As part of this degree, I took 12 different courses (36 hours) on a range of subjects.  In nearly every course, there was a requirement to write at least one academic paper.  I finished the master’s program in a year (two classes every 8 weeks), and it was tough.  Below are copies of many of the papers I completed.
