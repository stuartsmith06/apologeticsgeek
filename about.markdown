Hello! My name is Stuart. I’m an information security professional, a computer geek, U.S. Army Veteran, and most importantly a Christian “case maker.”  I’m married to my beautiful wife, Joyce.  We're also blessed to be grandparents!

When I was 17, I became a follower of Jesus of Nazareth. I was a nominal Christian at best, and in my late 20’s was challenged (by an atheist) about my beliefs. I discovered I really had no reasons to defend what I believed or why I believed it. This led me to the world of Christian apologetics. <img src="/images/stuart_smith.jpg" align="right">

Some may have never heard the word apologetics.  This doesn't mean we're "apologizing" for anything, but rather the word means to offer a defense or give an answer.  It comes from the Greek word <a href="https://biblehub.com/greek/627.htm" target=_blank><i>ἀπολογία</i></a> (apologia), which is most often cited in 1 Peter 3:15, "But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer [or defense, <i>ἀπολογία</i>] to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect" (ESV).

If you’re a follower of Christ, I hope you’ll find this blog site informative and encouraging. I have a passion for Christian apologetics, and it is my desire to help my fellow Christians strengthen their faith. I’m an accomplished public speaker and presenter in the field of technology and information security, and I’m also using my talents in the area of apologetics.

Christianity is true, which is why I am a Christian. If you’re a skeptic, non-Christian, or even an atheist, I hope to give you something to think about—I want to put a stone in your shoe, so to speak. Feedback and dialog is always welcome, and email is the best way to reach me.

I have a Bachelor’s Degree in Management Information Systems, a Master’s Degree in Theological Studies, and a second Master’s Degree in Cybersecurity all through Liberty University(Go Flames!).  Additionally, I hold several professional information security certifications, including Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP®) and Certified Information Security Manager (CISM).  I also have an amateur radio (aka "ham") license.

I served in the U.S. Army from 1989 – 2001, and was stationed in Germany, Korea, and several bases around the United States. I served a combat tour in the Middle East during the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War in a combat engineer battalion with the First Infantry Division (the famed Big Red One). I spent my last few years in the Army stationed at the Pentagon, and I’ve traveled extensively both with the military and as a civilian.  The current count is over 20 countries.  You can see an interactive Google Earth Map of the places I've been <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1Kw3WzaX7bcaNglyn8HsTgVosYaE&usp=sharing" target=_blank>here</a>.

Other than Christian case-making, I also have an interest in technology and cybersecurity.  I have another blog called <a href="https://www.digitalsheepdog.com" target=_blank>Digital Sheepdog</a>, which you may find interesting.
