Here is a list of some of my favorite apologetics blogs and other resources.  Many of these have been instrumental in my own journey into the world of Christian apologetics.

“Professional” Apologetics sites.  Many of these also have a regular podcast and YouTube channels that I listen/watch:

* Stand To Reason
* Cross Examined
* Reasonable Faith
* Cold Case Christianity
* Ravi Zacharias International Ministries
* Apologetics 315
* White Horse Inn & Modern Reformation
* Coffeehouse Questions

Foundational books I recommend:

* How to Read the Bible for All Its Worth (4th Edition) - Fee and Stuart
* Tactics:  A Game Plan for Discussing Your Christian Convictions - Koukl
* I Don't Have Enough Faith to be an Atheist - Geisler and Turek
* Cold Case Christianity - Wallace
* On Guard: Defending Your Faith with Reason and Precision - Craig
* Mere Christianity - C.S. Lewis (*slightly more advanced, but a good book for any Christian)

Advanced books I recommend:

* Time and Eternity:  Exploring Gods Relationship to Time - Craig
* Signature in the Cell:  DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design - Meyer
* Baker Encyclopedia of Christian Apologetics
* Improbable Planet: How Earth Became Humanity's Home - Ross
